                            Rochester Institute of Technology is number 3 on the princeton top 10 list for Game Design schools, which barely captures all that this school has done for me. In my time at RIT I have been given every opportunity to grow as a developer and designer, ranging from courses that supported and grew my skills in programming, and game design. I was able to try out the skills they taught me in small ways like in class exercises, medium size projects like a class centered around 3 5-week projects, and a class that dedicated its entire semester to the creation of a single polished game- shown off at the schools big event: ImagineRIT.

                        <h3><i>Workinman Interactive</i></h3>
                        <p>
                            As a developer I worked on plenty of projects through their full life primarily web and mobile games, working on development and game design. 
                            On these projects I worked primarily as the sole developer, but also on occasion supported my teammates, or as a key contributor.
                             The extended work extended from ideation and the initial prototype, to final QA. 
                             Prototyping out key features early on, to see how well the idea works. 
                             Expanded on the initial prototype out into a full project, polishing features and adding small elements to truly bring games to life and make sure they are fun. 
                             This often comes down to ensure the user experience is smooth, and 'feels right'. 
                             Beyond that, I also have to ensure these projects are optimized to the best of my ability and clients standards. 
                             Working to keep load times and sizes down.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can see examples of these games on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.noggin.com/">Noggin App</a>. 
                            Or read <a target="_blank" href="https://workinman.com/noggin-block-star-challenge/">this article by workinman</a> about one such project that I had the opportunity to develop for. I am quite proud of this one. 
                            Its beautiful (thanks to the wonderful art team), functionally snappy, and exciting to play. So no matter how old you are 3, or 30, the game is fun and addicting. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At workinman I also spent time developing and expanding an in-house Phaser 3 game template. Adding new usability, utility, 
                            and other features to help with rapid and quality development. This includes features like a voice over system for playing vo easily,
                            assets loading system to make Phasers asset loading more automated, and thus more user friendly and honestly less likely to give my co-workers, or myself, arthritis.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            In addition to my normal projects, I also was the maintainer of a Live unity project. This meant implementing and delivering monthly content updates.

                        <h3><i>Second Avenue Learning</i></h3>
                        <p>
                            Durring my internship at Second Avenue Learning I worked on a few different projects. 
                            My main focus was a game for the nintnedo switch- built using the nintendo sdk and unity 3d. 
                            On this project I worked on updating existing features and gameplay mechanics to feel better for the player, 
                            update and expand the User Interface, adding new features and mechanics, and getting the project ready for release.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, I assisted with a feature for a a mobile app, more specifically I developed a way to resolve* a known issue on Android. The resolution was a workaround utilizing a plugin found designed with the issue in mind, and developing systems to accomdate some of the repercussions of the workaround plugin. A fun balance of what was best for the application that was being created, the experience of the users, and tryign to make th best of the situation creted by the limitations of the technology being used. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also worked on develping an open source web application. For this project I did work developing front-end modules for features that would be used throughout multiple pages of the application. On top of that I worked on reworking some features from the prototype to be better suited for the demo version.
                        </p>
                            Finally, for a short period I did some minor Quality Insurance work while I was between projects. This extended to running through a web application to make sure features worked on multiple browsers and operating systems, as well as find niche bugs and document all that I found.

                            Durring my internship at Diebold Nixdorf I was a part of the New Technologies Incubation team, which focused on ATM service inprovement durring my time there.
                            We used Splunk, a data analytics platform, to help analyse and visualize data surrounding the issues of ATMs and help speed up or even automate the resolution of 
                            issues. Connected to that, I was able to help automation within our production enviroment using javascript with cscript to help process data. Finally, I was also
                            loaned to another department to create a demo of Diebold Nixdorfs new Fusion ATM concept for a financial technology expo/conference. The demo was built using Unity 3D and ios ARKit plugin. For that project I was the only programmer, and worked with an UX desinger and 3D artist.
