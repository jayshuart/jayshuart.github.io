            <h3><i>"A web based audio visualizer."</i></h3>
            <p>
                An audio visualizer that utilizes javascript and html Canvas. My partner and I created a simple visualizer that have a decent degree of control over the stylings ove said visualizer. Built in a mirrored circular format, it has the ability to represent the audios frequency of waveform as lines, circles, or bezier curves. ON top of that We added visualing appeal features such a spin, fade effects, and a radial gradient to the visualizer to give it more life. Finally, we expanded on controls over the audio beyond volume, and pause or play- we gave control over bass and treble.

            <h3><i>"A web based sliding-tile puzzle game"</i></h3>
            <p>
                A simple puzzle game about shifting all the puzzles pieces into their proper places by using the WASD to shift pieces around the open block. Structured using IFFE to help encapsulation within a website, and Object Literals to simulate classes. By defining how many divisions, aka divs, the player wants a picture (which just happens to still be the placeholder picture of me) to be cut into the game will create rectangles holding part of the picture, scramble them and remove one to allow for solving. Once the pictur eis back in it's original order fun lil particle effects will go off and the player wins. 
                
                <br /> <br />
                Note: Currently does not work in Google Chrome, but confirmed to work in Microsoft Edge.

            <h3><i>"Mobile twist on the childhood classic"</i></h3>
            <p>
               We wanted to bring a childhood game to life on a mobile platform, so we took jumping around of sofas and turned it into jumping from platform to platform to avoid lava on your phone. We aimed for a game that would keep players on edge and moving forward, but also be simple. We took steps to ensure that players kept moving by maving platforms sink and heat up the longer the player stayed on it, and conveyed that to the player by making it more and more red.
                <br /> <br />
                This game was another victim of time constraints, leaving us with only one level and a rolling feature shoehorned in at the last minute. Given more time we would rebuild the rolling control, and create our stretch goal of an endless running mode.

            <p>
                Welcome to Oktoberfast, an up and coming tavern! You are a server who must run around the bar delivering drinks to patrons without spilling all the beer in the process. Remember: our customers wonâ€™t wait long for their beer, so get them their beer.
