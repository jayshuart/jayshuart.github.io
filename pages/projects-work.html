                        <p>
                             Puzzle game where pre-schoolers must place puzzle like tile pieces in order to create paths for Peppa to follow and find her friends, hidden about in each level. 
                             Made in Phaser 3 for html5.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This game had a few core components, firstly the path finding system, where Peppa follows open paths. 
                            The in-game system is more robust than the final use, as early iterations had more flexible levels. 
                            Secondly, to help quick iteration on designing levels, I built a level importer system that took simple xml files. 
                            So that team members could edit level layouts in a simple spreadsheet and could be quickly played ingame. 
                            Lastly, the game has an interesting variety mechanic I built. 
                            All 15 levels could be in any one of three world styles (Dino Park, Fall, and Beach) where a level 
                            could have one of multiple Hiding Spot types (ex: under a table or behind a dinosaur) along with a mixture of of multiple 
                            distractor hiding spots, an path blockers styled like points of interest and general environmental art.

                        <h3><i>Brilliant Math Builder is the third entry into the builders series, started with Blaze Mega Math</i></h3>
                        <p> 
                            This game continued what was great about Mega Math and expanded upon it. 
                            Like its predecessor it used the 2 layered approach, one layer creating a bustling world for kids to collect interactions for and make lively, 
                            and on the other layer math activities. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this game we expanded the sandbox world layer by introducing vehicles as earnable from the math activities to help the bustle of peppas world. 
                            A lot of the core systems of this game were rebuilt form the ground up, allowing us to bring out the best we could offer and make an even more 
                            exciting and lively world than previous games in thie builders series

                            I worked on the expansion update for Friends: Create + Color. 
                            The original game let players create a friend, reminiscent of one of three Noggin properties. 
                            Styling their features, clothes, and accessories and finishing up with a picture moment. 
                            For the expansion we added more to customize with, and totally redid the picture moment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pictures went from one selfie, to action shots set in various places aligned with each IP. 
                            Letting players not only create themselves but set a scene and fill it with characters they know and love.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The focus was on players creation, so the gallery menus got an update showing their created avatars as well as gallery fo photos. 
                            Allowing three save slots for each for characters and galleries, per IP.

                            Mega Math Builder is a game in two layers, firstly a lively world players can fill with shops and sights that come to life at the click of a button. 
                            Secondly, a course of math curriculum questions for kids to master.

                            In PAW Patrol: Create + Color, players paint their own fish, and watch them come to life... 
                            and maybe learn along something about fish along the way! 
                            I worked on bringing these fish to life by creating different AI behaviors for each fish type as well as tappable 
                            reactions for more direct play.

                            I helped bring this project to completion, taking over for the previous dev 3/4 of the way through development.
                            This involved adding new fish and characters behaviors, updating existing ones, implimenting VO, major game low changes, and polish.

                            A personal favorite of mine! 
                            Block Star Challenge is a fast paced set of super snappy mini-games themed on competitive physical courses like American Ninja Warrior and Wipeout!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For this game I created a set of multiple mini-games with various interactions, each designed to be incredibly snappy and satisfying, to help underline the high octane fun and feel like a skilled competitor. 
                            - dragging blocks in order to stack them and create a set of steps
                            - swiping ladder rungs into place
                            - cranking a wheel by swiping in circles
                            - lowering bridges for your competitor to cross
                            - placing colour & size coded bridges to go make a path
                            - picking the desired balloon to cross a gap
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each game consisted of a few of the above described interactions, 
                            where players have only seconds to complete as many instances as they came and rack up points.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On top of all that I created a co-play experience where kids would be able to take turns passing their device in order to 
                            compete with one another. Noggin has used this game as the bassis for all their following co-play games.

                            Wrap it Up! Was the first of a series of 5 (at time of writing) STEM games. 
                            In wrap it up I developed a set of physics mechanics that let players get a ball to the target space by doing things like bounce it
                             on a spring, let it ride a conveyor, and turn through pipes. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Wrap It Up! was designed and created as a puzzle game where kids would have to select the correct pieces in order to make it to the goal. 
                            Players were given feedback based on their choices in an tiered hint system.                             
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Later games in this STEM series based on wrap it up would go into a sandbox environment, showing the versatility of the available tools. 
                            In all later games, I either helped from a point of insight on our client and users needs, advising the developer when needed on mechanical changes, 
                            or was the lead developer myself in cases like Halloween or Musical entries to the series.

                            I added new features like a set of additional brush types, 
                            as simple as different looks to as complex as the magic coloring brush that reveals a coloured painting. 
                            Along with other features like zoom toggling for more precise painting, 'bucket' painting style erasers, and toggling color-by-numbers.

                            As for tools and improvements to the game, I worked on tools that cut down development times for content updates by half. 
                            As well as minimized possibility for user-error borne issues during development by automating content integration systems for pages, patterns, and stamps 
                            not to mention creating error verification systems like an internal auto-colouring tool. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is a fantastically collaborative project, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the efforts of my coworkers. 
                            Due to the length of the project I had the opportunity to work with every artist at Workinman! Each and every one of them did great work.

                            The Original Mobile Games is a collection of digitized history, 
                            offering a whole slew of classical dexterity games and their history to users on Nintendo Switch and Mobile.

                            I worked as an intern at 2nd Ave, poarting and updating this game from mobile to the Nintendo Switch. This was not just about porting but improving the games.
